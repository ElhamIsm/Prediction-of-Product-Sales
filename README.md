## Introduction: 
This project will be analyzing the sales of different food items sold at various outlets. This analysis will play a role in predicting the sales of these items in the future and what factors affect the selling of these items. This will also help the retailor take descions that will lead into an increase in sales.

### To prepare this data, the data was cleaned, and then several processes were performed. Here are some of the visualisations produced during the analysis process:

- This boxplot figure shows that sales of most items fall within a range of $1000 - $3000. But despite that there are some outlier values that sold above our maximum of $6000 and even some items hold sales with a very large gap to the rest of products, selling a little more than $12000.

- This plot shows that low fat food items sell twice as much as regular fat products. This allows us to understand that our consumers lean more towards healthier food items with lower fat.
